# Artsy
Artsy is an online platform that connects artists with art collectors and enthusiasts. With Artsy, artists can showcase their work and connect with potential buyers, while collectors and enthusiasts can browse and purchase art from a wide range of artists.

## Features
- Drops
Artsy's Drops feature allows artists to release limited edition art pieces exclusively on the platform. Drops are time-limited, and once the time is up, the artwork is no longer available for purchase. This creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for collectors.

- Auctions
Artsy's Auctions feature allows collectors to bid on unique and rare pieces of art. Auctions are held regularly and feature artwork from both emerging and established artists. The bidding process is transparent, and collectors can easily track their bids and the status of the auction.

- Live Bids
Artsy's Live Bids feature allows collectors to participate in live bidding events. These events feature a curated selection of artwork and allow collectors to bid in real-time against other collectors. Live Bids events are a fun and exciting way to acquire art and connect with other art enthusiasts.
